Chrome allows for public key pinning, where you can tell it to only
allow a certain public key for a domain (optionally including
subdomains). There's a list of hardcoded key and domains, but the UI
for adding more is a bit awkward.

This tool will extract the public key signature from a host or .crt
file, and will give you the string you need to plug into Chrome.

Add under chrome://net-internals -> HSTS
